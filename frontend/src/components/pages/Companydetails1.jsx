Round 1 - PLAN and IDEATE

Registered teams need to select any theme (multiple themes can be selected, worked upon, and submitted in separate files) out of below 8 problem statements.
Teams have to identify whitespace, need gap, customer pain points, market size, value proposition, and business potential (min ₹1,000 Cr at 20-30% market share) for any of the following theme(s):
Space Utilization: With the ever-increasing need for expansive living, there is a demand for innovative solutions for space utilization. We are looking for product solutions to unlock the hidden potential of dead spaces in households and offices by utilization of overlooked and unused areas to enhance efficiency and accessibility, increasing convenience for the user.
Social Inclusion: Social Inclusivity in Public Spaces ensures that people of all backgrounds, abilities and ages feel comfortable and empowered to access them. We are looking for innovative solutions to enable public space accessibility for the differentially abled people by retrofitting existing infrastructure in line with the Universal Accessibility Code (Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016).
In-home Comfort: In-home comfort refers to various aspects which contribute to the enhancement of overall wellbeing at home such as air purification, HVAC, etc. We are looking for innovative product solutions targeting comfort in homes for both existing as well as new construction (excluding existing solutions available in the market).
Water Innovation: To address pressing global challenges related to water resources, ensuring the sustainable management of this vital resource for years to come, the focus is on innovative product solutions for driving resilience across the supply chain and ecosystems to re-energize water security at the community level.
Advancing towards Net Zero Buildings: Achieving net zero in commercial buildings such as offices, hospitals, etc. is a complex endeavour, requiring a combination of strategies and commitment to sustainability. It not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but could also potentially lead to long-term cost savings. Thus, Innovative, and sustainable solutions for commercial buildings - for both existing and new establishments have become the need of the hour.
Urban Waste to Wealth: India faces significant challenges related to urban waste management due to the rapidly increasing urban population. This holds great potential for economic and environmental benefits. We are looking to transform urban waste management space into a business opportunity through innovative solutions around waste from homes and offices such as solid waste, CnD waste, etc. (excluding E-Waste).
Rurban Housing and Infrastructure: Rurban mass housing and infrastructure is a critical component of sustainable and inclusive development of the country. This contributes to addressing issues of housing shortage, better living conditions, reduction in urban migration and enhancement of overall quality of life for citizens. Thus, there is an urgent need for ingenious solutions for safe, secure, and affordable housing and infrastructure such as social shelters, homes, medical centers, retail, skill development centers, etc. for rural, semi-urban communities.
Rural Livelihood and Productivity: The aspirational rural citizen's livelihoods are complex, influenced by a combination of factors and often require a multi-dimensional approach to enhance their earning potential. There is huge potential for innovative product-based solutions to boost rural economy with focus on areas like agriculture value chain and productivity, micro-enterprises, etc.
